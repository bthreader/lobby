## Message Codecs

A collection of codecs to allow messages to be sent and received efficiently across application components. The binary format used is the [Simple Binary Encoding](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding). SBE is the fastest amongst its peers at the cost of not being as flexible. However, given the messages in this project are very simple (notably, they don't feature variable sized fields) SBE is a perfect fit.

The schema for the messages can be found within `src/main/resources/messages.xml`. Codecs are generated by the `generateMessages` gradle task.
