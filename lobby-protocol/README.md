## Message Codecs

A collection of codecs to allow messages to be sent and received efficiently across application components. The binary format used is the [Simple Binary Encoding](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding) and messages are generated by the SBE tool.

The schema for the messages can be found within `src/main/resources/messages.xml`. Codecs are generated by the `generateMessages` gradle task.
